    <!-- music description-->
    <p> I started being musically involved when I was 5 and joined choir and continued that until I was around 9, and then started 
        piano lessons. Starting in 6th grade, I picked up the alto saxophone and was in wind ensemble from 8th grade to my senior year
        in high school.

    <!-- music life in college-->
        I've written a lot of songs partially but I finally wrote my first "full" song in University in Popular Songwriting class I took freshman year.

        Like other stuff on my website, I'll continue to update with more projects in the future.
